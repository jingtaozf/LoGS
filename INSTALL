LoGS 0.1.2 Installation Instructions

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Required Packages:
In order to use the LoGS build and test scripts, you will need the
following packages:

LoGS:
        http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/logs/
CL-PPCRE:
        http://www.weitz.de/files/cl-ppcre.tar.gz
CL-INTERPOL:
        http://www.weitz.de/files/cl-interpol.tar.gz
time.lisp:
        http://cybertiggyr.com/gene/pdl/time.lisp
CLUnit:
        (packaged with LoGS)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Unpacking:
tar -zxvf /path/to/LoGS_0.1.2.tar.gz
cd logs
tar -zxvf /path/to/cl-ppcre.tar.gz
tar -zxvf /path/to/cl-interpol.tar.gz

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Building LoGS without ASDF:

LoGS works with several different Common Lisps.  These instructions
assume CMUCL.

./Build_LoGS.sh

You should now have a LoGS.core file in the build directory.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing LoGS without ASDF:
        
./Test_LoGS.sh

You should see a message like this if everything went well:
TOTALS: 149 tests run; 149 tests passed; 0 tests failed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Building LoGS with ASDF:

In the ASDF directory, create sym links to the ASDF files of the
required packages.

I have 3 symlinks to LoGS.asd cl-ppcre.asd and cl-unit.asd in the ASDF
directory.

Then at the REPL if I say (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'LoGS) I'm done.  It
handles compilation and loading of all necessary packages.
        
You should now have a LoGS-sbcl.core file in the build directory.

The ASDF directory is implementation dependent and in my case it is
~/.sbcl/systems  The directory for CMUCL is different, so to avoid
duplication, what I've done is created a symlinked directory to the
SBCL directory.
        
SBCL comes with ASDF built in and such that you can even say (require
'package) and it will do the equivalent of what I wrote above.
        
	You should see a message like this if everything went well:
        TOTALS: 149 tests run; 149 tests passed; 0 tests failed.
